# ChickenBot
Fun Discord bot made with discord.js
Functionality:
+ Identify trigger words in user sent messages (ignores other bots)
+ Send text messages
+ Send images
+ Server Mutes/unmutes all users in a voice call (limited by the discord api rate limit)
+ Ping users to get their attention
+ Replace a user in a voice call (disconnects the user and sets bot nickname to the removed user)

Economy (still in the works!)
+ check balance
+ add balance
+ remove balance
+ give balance to another user
