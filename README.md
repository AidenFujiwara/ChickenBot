# ChickenBot
Fun Discord bot made with discord.js.

Functionality:
+ Identifies trigger words in user sent messages (ignores other bots)
+ Sends text messages
+ Sends embeded messages
+ Sends images
+ Server Mutes/unmutes all users in a voice call (limited by the discord api rate limit)
+ Pings users to get their attention
+ Replaces a user in a voice call (disconnects the user and sets bot nickname to the removed user)

Economy (still in the works!)
+ checks balance
+ adds balance
+ removes balance
+ gives balance to another user
